The limitations herein shall apply even if the software warranty remedy does not fully compensate Licensee for any or all losses, or even if Baloota knew or should have known about the possibility of consequential damages.</p>
    <p>In any event, Baloota&rsquo;s liability under this Agreement shall be limited to $100, or the amount of money which you paid to Baloota over the twelve month period under this Agreement immediately preceding any cause of action.</p>

The parties agree that the questions of law and fact in any action brought under this Agreement are unique to Licensee, and do not arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as any other licensees, and that Licensee may not join in any action by any other licensee under this Agreement.</p>
    <p><strong>11.3 Waiver</strong>.&nbsp; The waiver by any party hereto of a breach or a default of any provision of this Agreement by another party shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right, power or privilege that it has, or may have hereunder, operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege by such party.</p>
    <p><strong>11.4 Severability</strong>. In the event that any part or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction, only that individual part or provision, and not the entire Agreement, will be inoperative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
